# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have successfully built the basic structure of a React/Next.js frontend for the Tic Tac Toe game, connecting to the existing Laravel backend. The frontend provides a modern user experience with a clean, responsive design and maintains all the functionality of the original implementation.

## Recent Changes
- Created a Next.js project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Implemented core game components (GameBoard, GameStatus, GameResultModal)
- Developed custom hooks for game logic and WebSocket integration
- Built services for API communication with the backend
- Designed modern UI for game modes and game play

## Active Decisions

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- Using Next.js App Router for page routing
- Organizing components by domain (game, auth, layout, ui)
- Implementing TypeScript for type safety
- Using custom hooks for shared logic

### 2. State Management
- Using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef) for state management
- Implementing custom game logic hook for consistent game state
- Maintaining separation between UI components and business logic

### 3. API Integration
- Created a dedicated game service for backend communication
- Implemented proper interface typing for API requests and responses
- Set up error handling for API calls

### 4. WebSocket Implementation
- Custom hook for WebSocket handling using Laravel Echo
- Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections
- Event-based architecture for real-time updates

### 5. UI/UX Approach
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Consistent color scheme (blue for X, purple for O)
- Clean, modern interface with subtle animations
- Mobile-first approach

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix TypeScript type errors throughout the codebase
2. Complete authentication integration with Laravel Sanctum
3. Test WebSocket functionality with the actual backend
4. Implement chat functionality for online games
5. Add proper error handling for edge cases

### Upcoming Considerations
1. Add animations for game actions
2. Implement dark/light mode
3. Improve accessibility features
4. Set up comprehensive testing
5. Prepare for production deployment

## Current Challenges
1. TypeScript integration with Next.js and external libraries
2. Authentication flow with the Laravel backend
3. WebSocket connection handling in production environments
4. Error handling for network-related issues

## Technical Debt
1. Need to resolve TypeScript errors
2. Need to implement comprehensive test coverage
3. Need to optimize WebSocket connections for stability
4. Need to improve error boundaries and fallback handling
